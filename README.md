# Unity 3D Demo 

Welcome to the Unity 3D Demo repository! This demo comprises two interactive parts to illustrate Unity 3D capabilities.

## Part 1: Player Movement and Jumping

In this part, a dummy character awaits your command. Use the directional keys to navigate the player, and press the space key for a jump. Experience the fluidity and responsiveness of Unity's character controls.

## Part 2: Dummy Interaction with Objects

Part 2 introduces another dummy character alongside a box. Witness the second dummy's continuous punching animation as it interacts with the box. Marvel at the dynamic behavior where the box vanishes upon impact, showcasing the interaction between the dummy and objects.
